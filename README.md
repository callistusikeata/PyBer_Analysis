# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of Analysis

The aim of this analysis is to create a multiple-line graph showing total weekly fares for each city type. PyBer operates in three types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. We, initially, analyzed the ride count, average fare per ride, and average number of drivers, all grouped by the type of city. Additionally, we compared each city's metrics and the average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. For this exercise, we created a summary Dataframe that arranged total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver and the multiple line plot.

# Results

From the Dataframe summary, we observed that there is a trend between how populated a city is and the total number of rides, which directly affects the total number of drivers, total fare, and both averages. Though, total number of rides, drivers and fares decrease as the cities become farther from urbanized areas, the average fare per ride and per driver seems to increase. This can be explained by the accessibility of PyBer rides and drivers in rural areas. Less drivers in rural areas may lead to a higher average fare per ride and driver, as prices increase when supply is on the decrease.


With the multiple-line chart, we can compare total fares by city type over a period of five months. The number of rides seem to peak at the end of February and fluctuates during the month of March. All the graphs tend to follow the same trend throughout these months, except for the trend in suburban cities, where we see an increase during the month of April.


 
# Summary

According to our findings, the total fare by city type seems to increase during the month of April in suburban cities, the company should research as to the causes of the increase, and the total fare decreases for other types of cities.
We have noticed that average fare per ride and driver is higher when there are less drivers. With this information, the company can influence ride-share prices by limiting or increasing the number of drivers during a certain time to maximize profit.
Finally, the average fare per ride shows a steady increase from highly populated cites to less populated cities. However, the average fare per drive increases drastically when following the same trend. This indicates that the number of drivers may be exponentially lower than expected. The company may want to allocate more drivers to rural areas to optimize its profits.
